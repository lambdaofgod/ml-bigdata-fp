### Machine Learning
Classic [Andrew Ng's ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - probably the best default beginner course

[Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x)

[Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about)

Udacity [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)

#### Deep Learning
Udacity [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)

Unsupervised Feature Learning for Deep Learning [Tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/)

Kadenze [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-i/info)


### Big Data

[Data Science at Scale](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science)

[Data Science and Engineering with Apache Spark](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-engineering-apache-spark)

[Big Data University's courses](https://bigdatauniversity.com/) - not so good as Coursera or edX. Also the courses are Hadoop-centered.


### Functional Programming

[Scala Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)

[Introduction to Type Theory](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/onderwijs/provingwithCA/paper-lncs.pdf)
