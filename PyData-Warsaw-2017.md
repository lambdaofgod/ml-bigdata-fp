## PyData Warsaw 2017

PyData conferences are organized by NumFocus, a nonprofit supporting open source scientific computing (they support Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn and Jupyter among other things).

PyData Warsaw conference took place in Copernicus Science Centre. The conference spanned 3 days - one workshop + two conference days. I didn't attend workshops. Some of them seemed pretty basic, and others were not announced until the last week.

It seems like *interpretability* was a leitmotif of the conference. One of keynotes was [Towards Interpretable and Accountable Models](https://pydata.org/warsaw2017/schedule/presentation/58/) which covered both technical and social aspect of the topic. It was the first talk that mentioned LIME and Eli5 libraries. Interesting takeaway was that these libraries, in addition to their intended purpose, can help with debugging and choosing models.
