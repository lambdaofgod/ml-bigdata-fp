### Machine Learning
Classic [Andrew Ng's ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - probably the best default beginner course

[Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x) - more math-heavy and theoretical than Coursera ML

[Foundations of Data Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/bookMay2015.pdf) - book covers mathematical aspects of ML, especially Big-data type ML. First chapter contains theoretical aspects of 'the curse of dimensionality'.

[Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) - advanced, views ML from statistical standpoint. Contains examples in R.

Udacity [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)

#### Deep Learning
Udacity [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) - covers basic material, but pretty sketchy on theoretical foundations. Examples/labs in Tensorflow

Unsupervised Feature Learning for Deep Learning [Tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/)

Kadenze [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-i/info) - covers interesting applications of DL like image painting.


### Big Data

[Data Science at Scale](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science) - basic Big Data concepts. Contains interesting exercises, for example writing MapReduce programs.

[Data Science and Engineering with Apache Spark](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-engineering-apache-spark) - probably the best introductory courses for Apache Spark.
They use [Databricks Cloud](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) which basically is notebook environment with Spark setup.
Exercises use PySpark.

[Big Data University's courses](https://bigdatauniversity.com/) - not so good as Coursera or edX. Also the courses are Hadoop-centered.


### Functional Programming

[Scala Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) - remake of classical Coursera Scala courses.
[Scala by example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf) by Martin Odersky - really concise book on Scala and some FP. I found it really handy as supplementary resource for Coursera Scala courses.

[Introduction to Type Theory](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/onderwijs/provingwithCA/paper-lncs.pdf) lecture notes
