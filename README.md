### Machine Learning
Classic [Andrew Ng's ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - probably the best default beginner course

Udacity [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262)

[Understanding Machine Learning : From Theory to Algorithms ](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/)- introductory book on ML. Very clear on theory, with exercise sections for each subsection. Can be found on the internet.

[Foundations of Data Science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/bookMay2015.pdf) - advanced, covers mathematical aspects of ML, especially Big-data type ML. First chapter contains theoretical aspects of 'the curse of dimensionality'.

[Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf) - ML from Bayesian inference standpoint. Derivation of regularization in this framework is particularly valuable. Also contains information on structured models and variational inference.


#### Deep Learning

Hinton's [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/) - Coursera. Really comrehensive introductory course on Deep Learning. The most theory-oriented MOOCs. The only drawback is the course wasn't updated since its first iteration in 2013. Contains some programming exercises using Matlab/Octave. See [here](https://github.com/lambdaofgod/neural-networks-coursera-setup) for code setup.

Udacity [Deep Learning Nanodegree Notebooks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning) - cover whole range of topics, from basics to GANs. **Uses Tensorflow**.

[MXNet - the straight dope](https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope) - notebook-style deep learning course (covers both theory and practice). Uses **MXNet**, a pretty interesting framework - it supports both static computation graphs and dynamic computations. It also covers **Gluon**, high-level library for writing neural networks (like Keras, similar to scikit-learn API).

Kadenze [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-i/info) - covers interesting applications of DL like image painting.

[Deep Learning Implementations and Frameworks](https://sites.google.com/site/dliftutorial/) - comparison of DL frameworks. Covers **Torch.nn**, **Theano**, **Caffe**, **Chainer**, **MXNet**, **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. It is particularly useful for someone who knows one of these frameworks and wants to learn another.

#### NLP/Information retrieval

[Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) - introductory material on NLP. 3rd edition has much bigger sections on machine learning and neural network methods. Theory-oriented, one of few textbooks covering word embeddings.

[Natural Language Processing with Python (NLTK book)](http://www.nltk.org/book/) - introductory book using NLTK. Doesn't go as deep as S&LP, but contains lots of programming exercises and is more beginner-friendly.

[Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/) - classic IR book. Contains information ranging from index definition and construction to machine learning in search.

[Hands-on Text Mining and Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-mining-analytics) Pretty introductory, but covers useful Java libraries and provides reference articles. See [here](https://github.com/lambdaofgod/yTextMiner) for maven project template.

### Big Data

[Data Science at Scale](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science) - basic Big Data concepts. Contains interesting exercises, for example writing MapReduce programs.

[Introduction to Big Data & Scalable Machine Learning](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/training/index.html) - great introductory courses on Apache Spark.
They use [Databricks Cloud](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/), a notebook environment with Spark setup.
Lots of exercises using PySpark.

[Big Data University's courses](https://bigdatauniversity.com/) - not so good as Coursera or edX. Also the courses are Hadoop-centered.

### Functional Programming

[Scala Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) - remake of classical Coursera Scala courses.

[Scala by example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf) by Martin Odersky - really concise book on Scala and some FP. I found it really handy as supplementary resource for Coursera Scala courses.

[Introduction to Type Theory](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/onderwijs/provingwithCA/paper-lncs.pdf) lecture notes
